# We are building a TI_MSP432 to follow a simple track for ECE 3 at UCLA.
10/23/2025 - Calibrated car using provided paper and black "T" paper. Loaded data onto sheets. Offset data by orignal minimums, then took offset data's maximum and normlized data to 1000. Then, weighted said data.
10/30/2025 - Wrote code to give error values from google sheets file. Values were consistent with those values on sheets from calibration day with paper.
